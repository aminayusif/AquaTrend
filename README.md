## AquaTrend 🌊 

This project studies how water quality changes over time and uses machine learning 
to predict future conditions. It also explores different environmental scenarios, 
such as hot and dry weather, heavy rainfall, or pollution events. 

### 🎯 GOALS
--------
1️⃣ Understand seasonal and long-term trends in water quality.  
2️⃣ Build predictive models to forecast key parameters like dissolved oxygen, 
    turbidity, or water quality index.  
3️⃣ Test "what-if" scenarios to see how the water quality might change.  

### 💧 DATA
-------
The dataset contains dates and measurements of water quality parameters 
(e.g., pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, BOD, conductivity, nutrients).

### 🛠️ METHODS
-----------
- 📈 Time series analysis: finding trends, seasonal cycles, and correlations.  
- 🤖 Predictive modeling: using machine learning to make forecasts.  
- 🔮 Scenario testing: simulating different future environmental conditions.  

### 📊 RESULTS
----------
- 📉 Graphs of water quality trends over time.  
- ✅ Model performance reports (accuracy and error rates).  
- 🔎 Forecasts under baseline and stress scenarios.  

### 🚀 HOW TO USE
-------------
1. 💻 Install Python and the required libraries (see requirements.txt).  
2. 📂 Open the Jupyter notebook (AquaTrend.ipynb).  
3. ▶️ Run the steps to see the analysis, modeling, and forecasts.  
4. 📁 Check the "outputs" folder for plots and results.  

### 🌍 APPLICATIONS
---------------
- 🌱 Monitoring river or lake health.  
- 🏞️ Supporting environmental decision-making.  
- ☀️ Planning for climate or pollution impacts.
